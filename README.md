# Makemore Neural Networks

This repository contains my implementation and learning journey inspired by **Andrej Karpathy's "Makemore" video series**. The project explores the step-by-step process of building and understanding neural networks, focusing on concepts such as bigrams, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), batch normalization, backpropagation, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## üìö Learning Journey
I followed Andrej Karpathy's excellent video series, **"Makemore"**, to learn the concepts and implement them from scratch:
- [Makemore Video Series (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=2)

The repository is organized into parts based on the Makemore series:

### üöÄ Key Topics Covered
1. **Part 1: Bigrams**
   - Understanding basic n-gram models for text generation.
   - Building a simple bigram model from scratch.

2. **Part 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
   - Learning the basics of feed-forward neural networks.
   - Implementing an MLP for text generation.

3. **Part 3: Batch Normalization**
   - Exploring how batch normalization stabilizes training.
   - Manually implementing backpropagation for batch normalization.

4. **Part 4: Backpropagation**
   - Implementing manual backpropagation for a neural network.
   - Understanding gradients and their role in optimization.

5. **Part 5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Introducing CNNs and their use cases.
   - Building and training a CNN from scratch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
Each part of the series is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook:
- `makemore_part1_bigrams.ipynb` - Implementation of a bigram model.
- `makemore_part2_mlp.ipynb` - Implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
- `makemore_part3_bn.ipynb` - Adding Batch Normalization to the MLP.
- `makemore_part4_backprop.ipynb` - Manual backpropagation for the MLP.
- `makemore_part5_cnn.ipynb` - Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
