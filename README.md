Here‚Äôs the updated README.md to include the detail about generating names with a character-level language model:

# Makemore Neural Networks

This repository contains my implementation and learning journey inspired by **Andrej Karpathy's "Makemore" video series**. The project explores the step-by-step process of building and understanding neural networks, focusing on concepts such as bigrams, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), batch normalization, backpropagation, and a **WaveNet-style language model**. 

**The main goal of this project is to generate names using a character-level language model.**

## üìö Learning Journey
I followed Andrej Karpathy's excellent video series, **"Makemore"**, to learn the concepts and implement them from scratch:
- [Makemore Video Series (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=2)

The repository is organized into parts based on the Makemore series:

### üöÄ Key Topics Covered
1. **Part 1: Bigrams**
   - Understanding basic n-gram models for text generation.
   - Building a simple bigram model from scratch.

2. **Part 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
   - Learning the basics of feed-forward neural networks.
   - Implementing an MLP for text generation.

3. **Part 3: Batch Normalization**
   - Exploring how batch normalization stabilizes training.
   - Manually implementing backpropagation for batch normalization.

4. **Part 4: Backpropagation**
   - Implementing manual backpropagation for a neural network.
   - Understanding gradients and their role in optimization.
   - Pytorchifying the code!

5. **Part 5: WaveNet-style Language Model**
   - Implementing a hierarchical neural network with **embedding layers**, **batch normalization**, and **tanh activations**.
   - Using a stacked model with **consecutive flattening** to mimic WaveNet-style architectures for text generation.
   - Generating names by training a character-level language model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
Each part of the series is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook:
- `Makemore1` - Implementation of a bigram model.
- `Makemore2` - Implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
- `Makemore3` - Adding Batch Normalization to the MLP.
- `Makemore4` - Manual backpropagation for the MLP.
- `Makemore5` - Implementation of a WaveNet-style language model for name generation.
